## 🚀 Key Requirements & Implementation

### 1. 📊 Executive Dashboard Overview
*   **Summary Cards**: Real-time tracking of **Total Balance**, **Global Credits (Income)**, and **Operational Burn (Expenses)**.
*   **Equity Flux (Line Chart)**: High-dynamic range area visualization of capital trends over time.
*   **Asset Skew (Donut Chart)**: Categorical breakdown of expenditures with active-shape segment highlighting.
*   **Fluidity**: All charts feature high-fidelity entrance animations and responsive scaling.

### 2. 🧾 Smart Transaction Registry
*   **Full Ledger Integration**: Comprehensive list including **Date**, **Amount**, **Category**, and **Mutation Type**.
*   **Search & Filtering**: Real-time locating engine for specific entries and type-based data isolation.
*   **Sequential Sorting**: Sort by date or amount with dual-polarity toggle (asc/desc).
*   **Mobile Parity**: Fully responsive table architecture that collapses gracefully onto smaller viewports.

### 3. 🛡️ Role-Based UI (RBAC Simulation)
The application implements a secure role-switching protocol found in the **User Avatar Dropdown**:
*   **Viewer Role**: Read-only access to all analytics and the ledger. Mutation controls (Add/Delete/Edit) are suppressed from the UI.
*   **Admin Role**: Full administrative execution authority. Unlocks the "Log Flux" form and all ledger modification tools.

### 4. 🧠 AI Heuristics (Insights)
Advanced data-lake analysis that derives operational intelligence:
*   **Peak Drain Detection**: Automatically identifies the highest spending category.
*   **Mean Quantum**: Calculates the average value of all session transactions.
*   **Retention Yield**: Real-time calculation of the savings rate relative to total income.
*   **System Observation Log**: Context-aware status reports based on fiscal health.

### 5. 🧱 Professional Architecture
*   **State Management**: Centralized `FinanceContext` utilizing React Context API for global synchronization.
*   **Component Modularity**: 
    *   `src/components/layout/`: Global Navigation and Header systems.
    *   `src/components/charts/`: Reusable Recharts implementations.
    *   `src/components/table/`: Data-grid and pagination engines.
    *   `src/pages/`: Page-level orchestration.
*   **Persistence**: Session data is automatically replicated to `localStorage` for cross-session continuity.
